# Ligue-Creation-
Simulation of a football (or a generic sport) Ligue in C 

So basically I'm studying C . I studied a lil bit about the structs but not everything is clear. 

I'm trying to make a basic C program with teams and players, it could be an easy project for you guys but for me it's pretty complicated. 

You can find my code in the other file called ligue.c
